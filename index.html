        <p > My Name is: <b>Ehsan Elameen</b>.I love 
            technology because it's the triumph of the human intellect.
            The more I study and understand technology, the more I feel
            that nothing in the universe is out of reach. There's even 
            a great rush of power that comes from coding your first 
            simple <i>“Hello World” </i>program. Getting it to run successfully,
            seeing those two words on the screen and knowing that YOU put
            them there just makes you think of the endless possibilities…

       <!-- <h3>The difference between paddings, margins, and borders</h3>-->
        <p> The difference between paddings, margins, and borders is that:
             <i>Border</i> is the strip that goes around the elements
              of the content. <b>Padding</b> is the space between the content and
               the border.<b> Margin</b> is the space outside the border.
        </br>

            <i>Content + Padding + Border + Margin = Total Space</i>
